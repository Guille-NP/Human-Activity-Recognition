# Human Activity Recognition

### Datasets used 🗒️
- MPII Human Pose Dataset
- UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set

### Two approaches :mag: 
- Static: Pictures (Deep learning methodology)
- Dynamic: Smartphone sensor data (Machine learning methodology)

### Next steps ⏭
- Use more epochs for training the last model
- Increase the number of filters in the convolutional layers
- Expand the dataset
