# Human Activity Recognition

### Datasets used üìù
- MPII Human Pose Dataset.
- UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set.

### Two approaches :mag: 
- Static: Pictures (Deep learning methodology: Convolutional Neural Networks).
- Dynamic: Smartphone sensor data (Machine learning methodology: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest).

### Next steps ‚è≠
- Use more epochs for training the last model.
- Increase the number of filters in the convolutional layers.
- Expand the dataset.
- For the dynamic approach, use different strategies and another dataset.
