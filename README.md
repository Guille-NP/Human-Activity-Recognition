# Human Activity Recognition

### Datasets used
- MPII Human Pose Dataset
- UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set

### Two approaches:
- Static: Pictures (Deep learning methodology)
- Dynamic: Smartphone sensor data (Machine learning methodology)

### Next steps
- Use more epochs for training the last model
- Increase the number of filters in the convolutional layers
- Expand the dataset
